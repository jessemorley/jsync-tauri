# Todo

## Bugs
- [ ] Session contents in preferences doesn't display the .cosessiondb file
- [ ] Cancel transfer button doesn't seem to tbe working

## UI
- [ ] Progress bar completion polish
    - Progress bar should show as visibly full momentarily at completion of sync
    - When sync completes, flash/pulse a bright blue outline for 2s. As that fades, fade the progress fill colour out too
    - If a backup exists at a location, the BG color (and outline) should be the pale blue
    - The progress bar should be a more intense blue (similar to selected button/option colour in the Schedule section)
    - The sync button completion button should be the bright blue, not green
