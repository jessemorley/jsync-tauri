# Todo

## Bugs
- [ ] Session contents in preferences doesn't display the .cosessiondb file
- [ ] Cancel transfer button doesn't seem to tbe working

## UI
- If the location section is collapsed during backup, the completion outline should show around the window


- [ ] On session change, actually check to see if backups exist at the defined locations when setting location state (backed up or not)
    - May entail a way of storing backup locations on a session-by-session basis. (Store in session folder?) or setting default backup locations




# Completed
- [x] Progress bar completion polish
- [x] BUG: If a backup has been made to a location, that location shows blue for backed up, even if the session changes or the backup is deleted
